		<h2>Current Events in Boxing</h2>
		<p>Here are some recent or upcoming boxing events:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gervonta Tank Davis Defeats Ryan Garcia via Technical stoppage Following a devastating body shot. (April 22, 2023)</li>
			<li>Ksi Vs Joe Fournier (May 13, 2023)</li>
			<li>Canelo Alvarez-John Ryder (May 6, 2023)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There have been controversies surrounding the matchup between Tank and Garcia. The rehydration clause in the contract was in tank's favor as garcia seemed drained coming into the fight. It was still a great match for the sport of boxing as not many young undefeated fighters dare to put their record on the line against a tough opponent. </p>
